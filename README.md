# FacialEmotionDetector

A real-time facial emotion detector web app built with React and face-api.js. It uses the webcam to detect facial expressions such as happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgusted, and surprised, and displays the result instantly. All processing happens in the browser to ensure privacy and speed.
